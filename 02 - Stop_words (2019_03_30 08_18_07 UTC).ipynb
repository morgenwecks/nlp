    "In humans, memory is broken down into electrical signals in the brain, in the form of neural groups that fire in patterns. There is a lot about the brain that remains unknown, but, the more we break down the human brain to the basic elements, we find out how basic the elements really are. Well, it turns out computers store information in a very similar way! We need a way to get as close to that as possible if we're going to mimic how humans read and understand text. \n",

    "Generally, computers use numbers for everything, but we often see directly in programming where we use binary signals (True or False, which directly translate to 1 or 0, which originates directly from either the presence of an electrical signal (True, 1), or not (False, 0)). \n",

    "To do this, we need a way to convert words to values, in numbers, or signal patterns. The process of converting data to something a computer can understand is referred to as **\"pre-processing.\"** One of the major forms of pre-processing is going to be **filtering out useless data**. In natural language processing, **useless words (data), are referred to as stop words.**"

We use them in the English language, for example, to sort of \"fluff\" up the sentence so it is not so strange sounding. An example of one of the most common, unofficial, useless words is the phrase \"umm.\" People stuff in \"umm\" frequently, some more than others. This word means nothing, unless of course we're searching for someone who is maybe lacking confidence, is confused, or hasn't practiced much speaking. For most analysis, these words are useless."
